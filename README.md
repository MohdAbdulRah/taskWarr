Project Name: Task War

Description: Task War is an interactive web platform that gamifies task management and productivity by allowing users to earn points and rewards. Users can complete tasks to earn points, which can later be redeemed or used to unlock benefits. The platform includes leaderboards to foster friendly competition among users, motivating them to stay productive and engaged.

Key features:

Earn Points: Users gain points for completing tasks successfully.

Task Creation: Users can create tasks for themselves or for others, contributing to a collaborative task ecosystem.

Leaderboards: Track top-performing users based on points earned, promoting motivation and competition.

Task Categories & Deadlines: Organize tasks by priority, category, or due date for better management.

Rewards & Incentives: Points can translate into rewards, badges, or other incentives to increase user engagement.

Idea in a nutshell: Task War turns task management into a gamified experience, where productivity is rewarded, collaboration is encouraged, and users can compete to reach the top of the leaderboard.
